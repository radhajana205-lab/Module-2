# 🔺 Looping(Patterns)-Pascal's Triangle Generator in Python
## NAME: JANARTHANI R
## REF NO: 25017541
This project demonstrates a simple Python program to generate **Pascal’s Triangle**, where the number of rows is provided by the user.

---

## 🎯 Aim

To write a Python program that generates **Pascal's Triangle** using numbers. The number of rows is accepted from the user.

---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. Start the program.
2. Input the number of rows from the user.
3. Loop from 0 to the number of rows.
4. For each row:
   - Print appropriate spaces to shape the triangle.
   - Compute values using the formula:  
     \[
     C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}
     \]
5. Print all rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
6. End the program.

## 🧪 Program
n=int(input()

for i in range(n):

for space in range(n-i-1):

    print(" ",end="")

value=1

for j in range(i+1):

    print(value,end=" ")

    value=value*(i-j)//(j+1)

print()
## Sample Output
enter number of rows:5

        1
    
       1 1
   
      1 2 1
  
     1 3 3 1
 
    1 4 6 4 1
## Result
The program successfully generates Pascal's Triangle using looping statements. Each number is calculated based on the binomial coefficient formula and displayed in a triangle pattern.
